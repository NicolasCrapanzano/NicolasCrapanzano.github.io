                    - Notch spent one week building a prototype for a 3D cave simulator, based on another game called "Infiniminer" by Zachtronics.
                    The game consisted on a Lego-like playstyle, where everything was made out of cubes, wich you could remove and add.
                    The first release of the game was made privately on the TigIRC forums the 16 of may, and a public version
                    known as classic released was the next day and started seeing some small succes among the users of the forum.
